I removed the input.txt file and created a program to create it with random numbers for us. The program is to be ran by itself. It is add_to_input.cpp and needs to be compiled with g++ outside of the Makefile. This was the easiest and quickest way for me to do it. After you compile and run add_to_input, input.txt will have 100000. If you already have something you created to do the random numbers, you can just delete mine.
